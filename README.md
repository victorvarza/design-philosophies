# design-philosophies

1. Compound interest works in everything.

2. "Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler". Don't make things easy to do, make them easy to be used and understand.

3. Make a prototype as soon as possible and run it in production. Technical debt = company pays for nothing.

4. Each software application should do one thing very well.

5. Avoid fancy UX, focus on usability.
